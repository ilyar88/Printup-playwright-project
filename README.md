## Architecture

![Project Architecture](architecture.svg)

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Suite** | Test specs that define test cases in serial order |
| **Workflows** | Multi-step user flows (login, add client, add project, etc.) |
| **Page Objects** | Encapsulate UI element locators per page |
| **Fixtures** | Reusable utilities: assertions, UI actions, waits, hooks |
| **TDD** | Excel-driven test data parsed by ExcelReader |
| **Base** | Browser launch, navigation, and config access |

---

## Test Flow

Tests run **serially** since each step depends on the previous:

```
#1 Login  -->  #2 Add Client  -->  #3 Add Contact  -->  #4 Add Project  -->  #5 Add Material
```

Each workflow reads its data from `TestData.xlsx` and supports multiple iterations.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Playwright browsers installed

### Install
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

---

## Running Tests

### Run with browser selection
```bash
npm test chrome
npm test edge
npm test firefox
```

### Generate Allure report
```bash
npm run test:report
```

### Open Allure report only
```bash
npm run allure:report
```

---

## Multi-Browser Support

Configured in `playwright.config.js` with three projects:

| Command | Browser | Engine |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `npm test chrome` | Google Chrome | Chromium |
| `npm test edge` | Microsoft Edge | Chromium |
| `npm test firefox` | Mozilla Firefox | Gecko |

---

## Reporting

### Allure Report
- Every UI action is logged as an **Allure step**
- Tests are tagged with **Allure features** (Login, Client info, etc.)
- **Screenshots** are automatically captured and attached on failure
- Sensitive data (passwords, emails) is **masked** in reports

### Screenshot on Failure
Saved to `screenshots/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{testTitle}.png` and attached to the Allure report.

---

## Data-Driven Testing

Test data lives in `TDD/TestData.xlsx`, organized by sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ClientInfoFlow` | Client names, phone numbers, emails, roles |
| `ContactInfoFlow` | Additional contact details |
| `ProjectInfoFlow` | Project names, dates, urgency, file paths |
| `MaterialsInfoFlow` | Material types, thickness, colors, textures |

The `ExcelReader` parses each section by class name and returns an array of data objects.

---

## CI/CD - GitHub Actions

The workflow (`.github/workflows/E2E test.yml`) runs via **manual dispatch** with browser selection:

**Trigger:** GitHub Actions > Run workflow > Select browser (chrome/edge/firefox)

**Pipeline:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js 20
3. Install dependencies
4. Install Playwright browsers
5. Run E2E tests with selected browser
6. Generate & upload Allure report as artifact (30-day retention)
